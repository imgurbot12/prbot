Gitea PRBot
------------

#### Description

> [!WARNING]
> This Action is designed specifically with Gitea in mind
> and serves no purpose for Github Actions

A Simple Gitea Action designed to generate Automatic PR
Reviews via Github-Style
[Error Annotations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#example-creating-an-annotation-for-an-error)
in Automated Gitea Actions.

Since Gitea currently
[does not support "Error Annotations"](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/actions/comparison#create-an-error-annotation)
this fills in the gaps by anayzing the stdout of other action stages
and then can commit the messages to a single review using a designated
service account after the action completes.
